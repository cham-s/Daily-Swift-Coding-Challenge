# Daily-Swift-Coding-Challenge

In order to get a better undertanding of the Swift programming language I took
the challenge of trying to solve coding challenges every day.
The challenges mainly comes from The Swift Coding Challenge written by Paul hudson.
I really recommend the book, as it test your current knolwedge of the language.
The repo contains my own implementation of the solutions.
I indent to expand the sources of the challenges after finishing the book.
r/dailyprogrammer is also a great source for coding challenge.

The code mainly runs on macOSX platform
